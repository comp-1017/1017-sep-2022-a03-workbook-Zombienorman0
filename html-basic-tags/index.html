        this structure is a comment block in html files
        everything in this structure is not considered par of any
            content of the web page.

        Most tag elements in html are done in pairs
        these are called opening and closing pair tags
        there are some tags that are not in pairs and are referred
            to as empty tags(a.k.a. void)
        the opening tag indicates the start of the element
            and the closing tag indicates the end of the element
        the closing tag has the same name as the opening tag
            PLUS a slash (/) preceding the name

        the head area of the web page is NOT considered content
        the Tags within the head area are used by the browser to
            manage some display of the page, give additional documentation
            to the page, indicate charactersets, help with search engines,
            and many other assists.

            content within this area is to be expected by the browser

            these tages are referred to as hx tags

        <h1> Basic Html Tags</h1>
        <h3> Paragraph Tag</h3>
        <!--
            this is the coding block for the content in a paragraph
            the paragraph tag belongs to the "block" group of tags
            a "block" group tag places the content on a new line
            
            you can place all the paragraph text content on one physical
                line, however, that would require a lot of scrolling right and left.
            you can have word wrap active in the editor and it will NOT affect
                how the browser displays the paragraph cintent. you can place
                the content on seperate line and it will NOT affect how the 
                browser displays the paragraph content.
        -->
        <p> The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line when 
            the content is displayed by the browser. The browser does NOT display
            the content in a physical style of how it has been entered with the code
            in the html file.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is a second paragraph on the browser page, it will start a new line.
        </p>
        <!--
            if the wish is to use a component of a reserved tag(or the whole tag)
                you would be in trouble using the tag
            instead: you can use special character strings to represent components
                 of the tag susch as < (&lt;) and the > (&gt;) symbols
        -->
        <h3> List Tags:  &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt;</h3>

            <!--
                this is an anchor tag and is often incorrectly referred to as a link tag
                one should not us the phrase link tag because there is
                    actually a <link> tag used in the <head> area
                the anchor tag can take the person to:
                        - a different website
                        - a different web page within the same website
                        - a different location on the same web page

                parameters
                href: points to the desired location
                target: optional
                        default is the same browser display page

            <!--
                empty tag( void ) 
                the image tag does not have a closing tag because there is
